# Part 1 — Features

## 1. Two personas, one engine

| Persona | Mode | What you give | What you get |
|---------|------|---------------|--------------|
| **Candidate** | `candidate` | 1 resume + a job description | A fit score plus gaps and concrete suggestions to improve your CV for that job |
| **Recruiter** | `recruiter` | N resumes + 1 job description | A ranked shortlist, each with a score, evidence, and a verdict |

Both personas run the **same** underlying pipeline; only the orchestration around
it differs.

## 2. Six-stage agentic pipeline

Each resume flows through six specialised stages. A stage is a plain **function**
when the task is deterministic, and an **LLM agent** only when the task needs
judgment — this keeps cost down and behaviour reproducible.

| # | Stage | Type | Responsibility |
|---|-------|------|----------------|
| 1 | **PDF → text** | function | Extract raw text from the uploaded PDF |
| 2 | **Resume parser** | agent | Turn resume text into structured fields |
| 3 | **JD parser** | agent | Turn the job description into structured requirements |
| 4 | **Matcher** | agent | Score each section vs the JD, with quoted evidence |
| 5 | **Scorer** | function | Combine sub-scores into one deterministic weighted score |
| 6 | **Hygiene** | function | Objective resume-quality checks (links, numbers, etc.) |
| 7 | **Critic** | agent | Gaps, suggestions, verdict, and a confidence check |

## 3. Per-section scoring with evidence

Instead of one opaque number, the matcher scores **four sections independently**:

- **skills** (default weight 35%)
- **experience** (30%)
- **projects** (25%)
- **education** (10%)

Every section comes with **quoted evidence** from the resume and a one–two
sentence **reason**, so you can always see *why* a score was given.

## 4. Deterministic, tunable final score

The final score is a plain weighted sum — not an LLM guess:

```
final = (0.35 × skills) + (0.30 × experience) + (0.25 × projects) + (0.10 × education)
```

- **Reproducible** — same input always gives the same number.
- **Tunable** — weights can be overridden per request and are automatically
  normalised to sum to 1.0, so the score always stays within `[0, 1]`.
- **Auditable** — the response includes the exact weights and the per-section
  breakdown used.

## 5. JD-aware matching (the key differentiator)

The score reflects fit against **this specific job**, not a generic resume
rubric. The matcher knows the JD's required vs nice-to-have skills, minimum years
of experience, responsibilities, and qualifications, and judges the candidate
against them.

## 6. Self-correction loop

After scoring, the critic reports its **confidence** that the scores are
well-justified. If confidence (or the matcher's evidence quality) is below a
threshold, the pipeline loops **back to the matcher once** for a more careful
re-evaluation, feeding the critic's suggestions in as guidance. The retry is
hard-capped (default 1) so it can never loop forever.

## 7. Resume hygiene checks (deterministic, zero-LLM)

Objective, rule-based checks that are independent of the job description:

- Missing email / GitHub / LinkedIn links
- Placeholder or example URLs (e.g. `example.com`, `TODO`)
- Thin or missing skills list
- Missing projects, or generic project names (e.g. "Project 1")
- Experience bullets without quantified impact (no numbers)
- Missing education section

These produce a **hygiene score** (0–1) plus a list of issues. Hygiene is
**advisory**: it informs the critic's suggestions and is shown to the candidate,
but it does **not** change the JD-match score (keeping that score purely about
job fit).

## 8. Critic feedback

For each candidate the critic returns:

- **gaps** — specific JD requirements the candidate does not clearly meet
- **suggestions** — actionable advice (including relevant hygiene fixes)
- **verdict** — `strong_fit`, `moderate_fit`, or `weak_fit`
- **confidence_in_scoring** — drives the self-correction decision

## 9. Cost controls (fast vs full critic)

| Critic mode | Behaviour | When to use |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `full` | Critique **every** resume | Candidate mode, or small batches |
| `fast` | Score everyone, critique only the **top-K** | Large recruiter batches — saves LLM calls |

`critic_top_k` (default 5) controls how many top candidates get critiqued in fast
mode.

## 10. Parallel screening

In recruiter mode the JD is parsed **once** and reused across all resumes, and
the resumes are processed **concurrently** (`asyncio`). This is faster and avoids
the order-bias you would get from stuffing many resumes into one LLM call.

## 11. Provider-agnostic LLM

The LLM is chosen by configuration, not hard-coded. Switching providers is a
one-line env change with **zero code changes**:

| Provider | Default model | Free-tier headroom |
|----------|---------------|--------------------|
| **Gemini** | `gemini-2.5-flash` | ~20 requests/day |
| **Groq** | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | ~14,400 requests/day |

The live demo runs on Groq for headroom.

## 12. Explainability / audit trail

Every run records a **trace** — one entry per stage that executed (with notes
like `score=0.62` or `retry=1`). Combined with per-section evidence, this makes
any result fully explainable and debuggable.

## 13. Run persistence

Every screening run is saved with a unique `run_id`, so results can be retrieved
or listed later. Vercel uses PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL`; local development
defaults to SQLite. Initialize the production schema with `scripts/init_db.py`.

## 14. HTTP API

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/` | Web UI (single page) |
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness check |
| `POST` | `/screen` | Screen resume PDF(s) against a JD; returns ranked results |
| `GET` | `/runs/{id}` | Retrieve a stored run |
| `GET` | `/runs` | List recent runs |
| `GET` | `/docs` | Interactive Swagger UI |

## 15. Web UI

A clean, dependency-free single-page frontend (served by the API itself):
job-description box, mode and critic toggles, multi-PDF upload, and a results
view with score, verdict badge, per-section breakdown bars, gaps, suggestions,
and hygiene. No build step, no frameworks.

## 16. Robust input handling

- Clear `422` errors for empty JD, missing files, unreadable PDFs, or invalid
  mode values.
- `503` with a helpful message if the LLM key is missing/misconfigured.
- Empty or image-only PDFs are handled without crashing.

## 17. Tested and linted

70 offline tests (using a fake LLM, so no API key or network is needed to run
them) plus `ruff` linting. Every stage was also verified live against a real LLM.

## 18. One-command deployment

Ships with a native Vercel FastAPI entrypoint and `vercel.json`. After configuring
environment variables and PostgreSQL, deploy with `vercel --prod`. The existing
API and UI run together; durable run history lives in PostgreSQL. The Dockerfile
remains available for local use. See the README for setup and request limits.

# Part 2 — How It Works

## 2.1 High-level pipeline

For a single resume, the stages run in order, with one optional loop back to the
matcher driven by the critic:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Resume PDF] --> B[PDF → text<br/>function]
    JD[Job Description] --> C[JD parser<br/>agent]
    B --> D[Resume parser<br/>agent]
    D --> E[Matcher<br/>agent]
    C --> E
    E --> F[Scorer<br/>function]
    F --> G[Hygiene<br/>function]
    G --> H[Critic<br/>agent]
    H --> I{needs_rescore<br/>and retries left?}
    I -- yes --> J[increment retry,<br/>inject feedback]
    J --> E
    I -- no --> K[Candidate result<br/>score + gaps + suggestions]
```

**Why this shape:**

- The **parser** is separate from the **matcher** so one resume can be parsed
  once and matched against many jobs (or reused across a batch).
- The matcher returns **sub-scores + evidence**, not a final number, so scoring
  stays deterministic and tunable.
- The **scorer** is a pure function — the final number is always provable.
- The **critic** runs last and gates the self-correction loop.

## 2.2 Function vs. agent decision

The single most important design rule: use an LLM only when judgment is required.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    T[A task in the pipeline] --> Q{Needs judgment<br/>or interpretation?}
    Q -- No --> F[Plain function<br/>deterministic, cheap, testable]
    Q -- Yes --> A[LLM agent<br/>structured output]
    F -.example.-> F1[PDF→text, scoring, hygiene]
    A -.example.-> A1[parsing, matching, critique]
```

This keeps the system cheap (fewer LLM calls), reproducible (deterministic where
possible), and genuinely "agentic" only where it adds value.

## 2.3 The shared state

Every stage reads from and writes to one shared, typed object —
`PipelineState`. It starts with just the inputs and accumulates results as the
pipeline runs:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph PipelineState
        direction TB
        IN[Inputs:<br/>resume_raw, jd_raw, config]
        S1[resume_structured]
        S2[jd_structured]
        S3[match_result]
        S4[final_score]
        S5[hygiene]
        S6[critique]
        RC[retry_count]
        TR[trace + errors]
    end
    P[Parser] --> S1
    JP[JD parser] --> S2
    M[Matcher] --> S3
    SC[Scorer] --> S4
    HY[Hygiene] --> S5
    CR[Critic] --> S6
```

Using explicit Pydantic models (not loose dicts) means the framework validates
the data passing between stages, and the whole pipeline is self-documenting.

## 2.4 Scoring math

The matcher emits one sub-score per section; the scorer combines them.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SK[skills 0.80] -->|× 0.35| SUM
    EX[experience 0.30] -->|× 0.30| SUM
    PR[projects 0.60] -->|× 0.25| SUM
    ED[education 1.00] -->|× 0.10| SUM
    SUM[weighted sum] --> R[final score 0.62]
```

Worked example:
`(0.80×0.35) + (0.30×0.30) + (0.60×0.25) + (1.00×0.10) = 0.62`.

Weights can be overridden per request; they are re-normalised to sum to 1.0, so
the final score is always between 0 and 1.

## 2.5 The self-correction loop

The decision to loop is **deterministic** — the LLM provides a confidence number,
but the *rule* that acts on it lives in code (so the behaviour is predictable and
tunable):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    C[Critic produces confidence_in_scoring] --> D{confidence < threshold<br/>OR evidence_quality < threshold?}
    D -- No --> E[Done — finalise result]
    D -- Yes --> R{retry_count < max_retries?}
    R -- No --> E
    R -- Yes --> L[retry_count += 1<br/>feed suggestions to matcher]
    L --> M[Matcher re-evaluates]
    M --> C
```

- Default `confidence_threshold` = 0.6, default `max_retries` = 1.
- On the retry pass, the matcher receives the critic's suggestions as extra
  guidance, so the second attempt is better grounded.
- The cap guarantees the loop always terminates.

## 2.6 Two-mode orchestration

Above the single-resume pipeline sits the orchestration layer that handles
candidate vs recruiter and fast vs full critic:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    START[screen request] --> PJD[Parse JD once]
    PJD --> FAN[Run pipeline per resume, in parallel]
    FAN --> MODE{recruiter + fast mode?}
    MODE -- No, full --> CR1[Critic already ran inline<br/>for every resume]
    MODE -- Yes, fast --> SK[Skip inline critic,<br/>score only]
    SK --> RANK1[Rank by score]
    RANK1 --> TOPK[Critique only top-K]
    CR1 --> RANK2[Rank all by score]
    TOPK --> RANK2
    RANK2 --> OUT[ScreeningResult:<br/>ranked candidates]
```

- **full** mode: the critic runs inside each resume's pipeline.
- **fast** mode: all resumes are scored first, then only the top-K are critiqued —
  saving LLM calls on large batches.
- Either way, the JD is parsed once and resumes run concurrently.

## 2.7 Request lifecycle (API → result)

What happens end-to-end when the UI (or a `curl`) calls `POST /screen`:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Browser / client
    participant API as FastAPI
    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant G as LangGraph pipeline
    participant LLM as LLM (Groq/Gemini)
    participant DB as PostgreSQL or local SQLite

    U->>API: POST /screen (PDFs + JD + mode)
    API->>API: extract text from each PDF
    API->>O: screen(resumes, jd, config)
    O->>LLM: parse JD (once)
    par for each resume (parallel)
        O->>G: run pipeline(state)
        G->>LLM: parse resume
        G->>LLM: match vs JD
        G->>G: score + hygiene (deterministic)
        G->>LLM: critic (+ maybe 1 retry)
    end
    O-->>API: ranked ScreeningResult
    API->>DB: save run (assign run_id)
    API-->>U: JSON result (rendered by UI)
```

## 2.8 Provider abstraction

Agents never import a concrete LLM class. They ask a factory for a model, and the
factory reads configuration to decide which provider to build:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    AG[Any agent] --> F["get_chat_model()"]
    F --> CFG{LLM_PROVIDER}
    CFG -- gemini --> GEM[ChatGoogleGenerativeAI]
    CFG -- groq --> GRO[ChatGroq]
    GEM --> BASE[BaseChatModel]
    GRO --> BASE
    BASE --> AG
```

Because every provider implements the same `BaseChatModel` interface (with
`.with_structured_output()`), switching providers is purely a config change.

## 2.9 Persistence and retrieval

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SCR[POST /screen] --> SAVE[Save result as JSON row<br/>with run_id + timestamp]
    SAVE --> DB[(PostgreSQL or local SQLite)]
    DB --> GET[GET /runs/id]
    DB --> LIST[GET /runs]
```

Each run is stored as a single JSON row keyed by `run_id`. A fresh connection is
opened per operation, which keeps the store safe to use from the API's worker
threads.

## 2.10 Component map

How the source modules relate:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph api["api/"]
        MAIN[main.py — endpoints + UI]
    end
    subgraph pipeline["pipeline/"]
        SCREEN[screen.py — orchestration]
        GRAPH[graph.py — LangGraph wiring]
        SCORE[scorer.py]
        HYG[hygiene.py]
    end
    subgraph agents["agents/"]
        PARSE[parser.py]
        JDP[jd_parser.py]
        MATCH[matcher.py]
        CRIT[critic.py]
    end
    subgraph core["core"]
        STATE[state.py — models]
        LLMC[llm/client.py]
        PDF[pdf.py]
        STORE[storage/runs.py]
    end

    MAIN --> SCREEN
    SCREEN --> GRAPH
    GRAPH --> PARSE & JDP & MATCH & SCORE & HYG & CRIT
    PARSE & JDP & MATCH & CRIT --> LLMC
    MAIN --> PDF
    MAIN --> STORE
    GRAPH --> STATE
```

## Summary

multi-agent-resume-screener combines **deterministic functions** (PDF extraction, scoring,
hygiene) with **LLM agents** (parsing, matching, critique) in a LangGraph
pipeline that is JD-aware, self-correcting, explainable, and provider-agnostic —
served through a tested HTTP API with a simple web UI and durable run persistence.
