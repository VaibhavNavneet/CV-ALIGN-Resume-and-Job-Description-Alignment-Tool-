"""Deterministic scorer: combine matcher sub-scores into a final score.

This is intentionally a plain function, not an agent. Keeping the final score
deterministic means it is reproducible, unit-testable, and tunable (via weights)
without touching any LLM prompt. Given the same ``MatchResult`` and weights, the
output never changes.

    final_score = Σ weightᵢ · sub_scoreᵢ      (sections i)

Because ``PipelineConfig`` normalises weights to sum to 1.0 and every sub-score
is in [0, 1], the final score is always in [0, 1].
